# AI-HEALTHCARE-DASHBOARD

This project presents an AI-driven healthcare dashboard built with Streamlit, integrating:

    Machine Learning (XGBoost & GRU)
    
    Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits (Thompson Sampling)
    
    Real-time visual analytics with synthetic patient data
    
    Interactive data visualizations

It simulates a real-time monitoring environment for hospital administrators and clinicians, enabling data-driven insights and treatment recommendations.

**Features**
Real-Time Streamlit Dashboard
5 interactive visualizations (line chart, pie chart, histogram, box plot, etc.)

2 live tables showing patient data and procedure summaries

Fully dark-themed for clinical readability

**Machine Learning Models**
XGBoost: Predict patient outcomes using static demographic and clinical features

GRU (PyTorch): Predict outcome variables based on temporal symptom progression

**Personalized Recommendations**
Thompson Sampling (Multi-Armed Bandit) based on patient context (e.g., gender + condition)

Dynamic treatment recommendations that adapt based on prior successes

**Synthetic Streaming Data**
100-row dynamically simulated patient records with demographics, medical conditions, procedures, satisfaction scores, and costs
